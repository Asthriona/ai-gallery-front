                Hi, I'm Asthriona as you may already know. <br />
                I made this website, so I can share my AI jouney with my friends without spamming their socials with images, and videos and whatnot. <br />
                if you like art and AI, please enjoy my best creations! <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel like I should state my stance on Art generation by IA. <br />
                Yes AI is a powerful tool, and I understand the fear of artists. <br />
                This "art" and any other "artwork" I generate by AI <u><b>wont</b></u> be seriously used as brand image or whatever. <br />
                if I happen to generate an image good enough to be used as a brand image, I will definitly contact an artist to make it better/fix it and credit them as creator. <br />
                This website is just me having fun with some tools I made/found. <br />
                Once I start working on other AI related projects I will update this website to show the rest of my works, and share video or whatever. <br />
                To get updated on this I recommend you to follow my personal blog: <a href="https://asthriona.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asthriona.com</a> I post all my code related stuff in here. <br />
                And I will also probabaly post something about image generation on my other less code related blog <a href="https://asthriona.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asthriona.space</a>
